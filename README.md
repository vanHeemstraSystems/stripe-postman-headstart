Based on "Getting Started with Stripe Postman" at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oviFGXrwYIQ

Postman collection at https://www.postman.com/stripedev/workspace/stripe-developers/overview

## 100 - Introduction

Learn how to use the Stripe public Postman collection to make test API calls to Stripe. Our new Postman collection includes templates all our API resources and makes it easy to explore Stripe's APIs and scaffold integrations without writing code.

## 200 - Getting your API secret key

Make sure you have registered with [Stripe](stripe.com).

Also, make sure you are in **Test Mode**, so not in Production Mode. This is indicated on the dashboard, where you will go next. You do not want to make Postman calls with your production key.

Go to the following URL to collect the API secret key: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/dashboard

It will look something like:

```
sk_test_............................................................................
```

## 300 - The Stripe Dev profile and workspace

Make sure you have an account with [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) and are signed in.

Open [Postman](https://www.postman.com) and from the search bar look for ***StripeDev***.
